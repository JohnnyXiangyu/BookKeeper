## TODOs  

### Implement a web app interface

Design a general purpose message bar to display system messages.  
Design a loading screen for login, so when LOGIN is clicked, it goes to that screen, wait until response from server. On success, jump to menu screen, on failure prompt a error message on message bar and render a back button.
