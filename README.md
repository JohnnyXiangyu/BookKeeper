# BookKeeper

 CLI bookkeeping app implemented with sqlite

## Some Features

 (all of which are in progress)  
 command line operations  
 symmetric key encryption (using a C++ module)  
 I'm too lazy to add proper doc

## TODOs  

 When there's no db file at given location, prompt the user to create a new one.
 (mentioned in py files) Add more columns and corresponding logic  
 add notification system (okay this one should be customizable)
